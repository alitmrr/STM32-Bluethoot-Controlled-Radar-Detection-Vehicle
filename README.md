# STM32-Bluetooth-Controlled-Car
I realized this project with my own efforts, not as a group work. I used stm32 card. The movement of the car is provided by connecting to the module with Bluethoot applications. The speed of the car can be adjusted with the potentiometer. However, the speed adjusted with the potentiometer may decrease with effects such as friction, so I used the Lm393 speed sensor. With this sensor, the speed of the car is measured. The speed value of the car and the total distance it takes are calculated and reflected on the LCD screen. In addition, we can observe the date and time on the LCD screen.
