# STM32-Bluetooth-Controlled-Car
 I used stm32 card and I wrote the code in cubeid program. The movement of the car is provided by connecting to the HC05 module with Bluethoot applications.There are 2 dc motors that provide the movement of the car. I used l298n motor driver to control these dc motors.There is an HC-SR04 distance sensor at the front of the car. Thanks to this sensor, the car is prevented from hitting any ground. In addition, the speed of the car can be adjusted with the Potentiometer in the car. However, the speed adjusted with the potentiometer may decrease with effects such as friction, so I used the Lm393 speed sensor. With this sensor, the speed of the car is measured. The speed value of the car and the total distance it takes are calculated and reflected on the LCD screen. In addition, we can observe the date and time on the LCD screen.
