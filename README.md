# STM32-Bluetooth-Controlled-Car
 I used stm32 card and I wrote the code in cubeid program. The movement of the car is provided by connecting to the HC05 module with Bluethoot applications. The speed of the car can be adjusted with the potentiometer. However, the speed adjusted with the potentiometer may decrease with effects such as friction, so I used the Lm393 speed sensor. With this sensor, the speed of the car is measured. The speed value of the car and the total distance it takes are calculated and reflected on the LCD screen. In addition, we can observe the date and time on the LCD screen.
