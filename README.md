# STM32-Bluetooth-Controlled-Car
 Stm32f446 card was used in the project. The movement of the car is provided by connecting to the HC05 module with Bluethoot applications.There are 2 dc motors that provide the movement of the car.  l298n motor driver was used to control these dc motors.There is HC-SR04 distance sensor in front of the car. There is SG90 servo motor under this sensor. This servo motor provides 180° movement of the sensor. The sensor collects distance data during this movement. As a result of 180° rotation of the sensor, a total of 500 distance data is obtained. In addition, the speed of the car can be adjusted with the Potentiometer in the car. However, the speed adjusted with the potentiometer may decrease with effects such as friction, so Lm393 speed sensor was used. speed of the car is measured with this sensor. The speed value of the car and the total distance it takes are calculated and reflected on the LCD screen. In addition, we can observe the date and time on the LCD screen.
